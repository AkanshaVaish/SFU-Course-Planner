# SFU-Course-Planner

The students of SFU face some problems during the time of enrollment for the next semesters and they want to know the complete information about the course. Students want to know about the previous terms in which this course was offered and which professors offered the course and how many students enrolled in the course and in which year and semester. In order to create this help for the students, there was a need of one stop webApp for SFU students and hence this app was designed so that students can get all the information about the courses during the time of their enrollment.

## Getting Started

The website is not hosted on the server yet. Hence the user needs to clone the project and run the website on the localhost. The user might want to download an IDE for java in order to easily understand the code and to run on the localhost. 

## Technical Information

The backend for the website was chosen to be JAVA and the front end was designed by using HTML and CSS and axiom. There is a need to work on the front end for website since it is not that user friendly. The focus should be on making the website more user friendly so that it is easier for students to use it. Moreover, the website is not tested for load balancing and incase, the traffic on the webiste is increased, there is a high chance that the website can crash. So, there is a need to take of that too.

## Contributing

If you think that there can be some changes that can be made in order to make the backend faster, the changes are welcome. You can make a change and generate a pull request and add some description to explain what was the need for the change and how it can be helpful and it will be considered.
